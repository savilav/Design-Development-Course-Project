# Cybersecurity Awareness for University Students

### Project Overview
This project raises awareness about the cybersecurity risks faced by university students, such as phishing messages, unsafe campus Wi-Fi, and reused passwords across platforms. It provides students with practical strategies to protect their personal and academic data while promoting safer digital habits across the campus community.

# 🧭 Target Audience
This website is designed for university students of all ages (18–50+), including:
- Undergraduate and graduate students  
- Returning adult learners  
- Part-time or evening students  
- Students using public, dorm, or campus Wi-Fi  
These users rely heavily on online learning platforms, but many are unfamiliar with cybersecurity fundamentals like VPNs, MFA, and password managers.

## **Understanding Daily Online Risks for Students**
Students frequently browse grades, submit assignments, join class meetings, and stream content across multiple devices. Many use public or campus Wi-Fi without realizing how easily unprotected data can be exposed.

## **Why Cybersecurity Matters in Universities**
Universities are major targets for cyberattacks due to large volumes of stored personal data and academic research. Real incidents—such as the 2025 University of Pennsylvania breach—show how attackers impersonate official accounts and access sensitive student information.
